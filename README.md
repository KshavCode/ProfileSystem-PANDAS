# Profile Creator System
Smart system which automically generates a profile ID card based on the details entered by the user like Name, Age, Gender, etc. This project has been implemented in 2 ways : JSON and PANDAS, while the main language is Python. It uses Pillow module to generate such profile along with a display picture and a background image.

## Required Package(s)
Python Version Used: 3.11

pandas, requests, numpy
```bash
pip install pandas, requests, numpy
```

## Installation Guide
Clone this repository and open one of the folders which you wish to see from and then run the python file. All the data is stored in either CSV or JSON while the images data is stored in their respective folders.

## Future Plans
1. To use SQL and implement this system.
2. Give an option to edit an already created card and overlap it with the changed information to avoid unecessary machine usage to generate aother whole profile card.
3. Instead of downloading image and storing it in a format, store it in a binary format or similar encoding in a textual form to avoid storage issues.
