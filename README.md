# Profile System (JSON) âŒ¨
A modern Company based example program which takes in details of an employee and stores it into JSON file (acts as a database). You can edit details of a person too if all the information about the person is correct. It takes in the name, age, gender, job title, wallpaper and a profile picture. You can also view the profile of an employee as the program generates a virtual ID card with the provided wallpaper and display picture in the file.

## Features âœ¨
The program automatically creates all the folders, so you needn't do anything other than running the program. If a person wants a wallpaper/dp which is available on internet then they can copy it's link and give the link while changing the picture based detail, which will make the program download that image from the internet and save it in the folder automatically.
